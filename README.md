Progressive session disclosure CLI for GitHub Copilot CLI. Queries your local `~/.copilot/session-store.db` to recall what you worked on across sessions — so your agent always has context.

## Why

Copilot CLI stores session history locally but has no built-in way to query it. `session-recall` gives you (and the agent) structured access to past sessions, files, and checkpoints — enabling progressive context recall without MCP servers or hooks.

## How it compares

| Approach | Dependencies | Writes to DB | Setup | Agent-native |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| **auto-memory** | None (stdlib) | ❌ Read-only | `pip install` | ✅ Instruction-file |
| MCP server | Node.js runtime | Varies | Server config | ❌ Protocol layer |
| Custom hooks | Varies | Often yes | Hook scripts | ❌ Event-driven |
| Manual grep | None | ❌ | None | ❌ Manual |

## Install

Tell your AI agent:

> Read `deploy/install.md` and follow every step.

Or run manually:

```bash
./install.sh
```

See [`deploy/install.md`](deploy/install.md) for full instructions, agent integration, and troubleshooting.

## Usage

```bash
# List recent sessions for current repo
session-recall list --json

# Show details for a session (prefix match)
session-recall show f662 --json

# Full-text search across turns
session-recall search "SQLITE_BUSY" --json

# Recently touched files
session-recall files --json

# Recent checkpoints
session-recall checkpoints --json

# 9-dimension health check
session-recall health

# Validate DB schema (run after Copilot CLI upgrades)
session-recall schema-check
```

## Health Check

```

```

## Design

- **Zero dependencies** — stdlib only (sqlite3, json, argparse)
- **Read-only** — never writes to `~/.copilot/session-store.db`
- **WAL-safe** — exponential backoff retry on SQLITE_BUSY (50→150→450ms)
- **Schema-aware** — validates expected schema on every call, fails fast on drift
- **Telemetry** — ring buffer of last 100 invocations for concurrency monitoring

## Agent Integration

Installation includes wiring auto-memory into `~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md` so your agent runs session recall automatically. See [`deploy/install.md`](deploy/install.md) for setup.

See [`UPGRADE-COPILOT-CLI.md`](UPGRADE-COPILOT-CLI.md) for schema validation after Copilot CLI upgrades.

## FAQ

**Is it safe? Does it modify my session data?**
No. auto-memory is strictly read-only. It never writes to `~/.copilot/session-store.db`.

**Does it work with Claude Code, Cursor, or Aider?**
Yes — any agent that supports instruction files can use session-recall. See `copilot-instructions-template.md` for integration patterns.

**What happens when Copilot CLI updates its schema?**
Run `session-recall schema-check` to validate. The tool fails fast on schema drift rather than returning bad data. See [UPGRADE-COPILOT-CLI.md](UPGRADE-COPILOT-CLI.md).

**Does it need an internet connection?**
No. Everything is local SQLite queries against your existing session store.

## Roadmap

- [ ] PyPI package publishing
- [ ] CI with GitHub Actions (pytest + ruff matrix)
- [ ] Session diffing (what changed between sessions)
- [ ] Export sessions to markdown
- [ ] Optional MCP server wrapper for IDE integration
- [ ] Richer health dimensions (token usage, context efficiency)
